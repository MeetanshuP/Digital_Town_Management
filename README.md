Digital Town Management System is a web-based platform designed to digitize and streamline town-level civic services and community interactions. Built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), the system provides a centralized portal where citizens can access local services, view news and events, participate in a community marketplace, submit feedback or grievances, and receive notifications. The platform incorporates secure authentication and role-based access control for users, service providers, and administrators, ensuring controlled and transparent operations. By integrating structured data management and scalable backend architecture, the system aims to improve efficiency, accountability, and citizen engagement in local governance.
